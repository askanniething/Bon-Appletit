# Bon-Appletit

Bon Appletit is a fun and interactive game designed to teach children about the importance of healthy eating. It consists of three different levels, each consisting of a tutorial and a mini-game to test knowledge. The game was coded with Java utilising the JavaFX libraries. 

Premise: Youâ€™re stuck on a stranded island, and there appears to be no way to escape. Luckily, Mac and Gala, the mascots, know of a monster named SweetPea who can help you out by sending a signal! All you have to do is learn about and complete the three levels in the game.
